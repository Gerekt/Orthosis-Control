A Convolutional Neural Network powered control system for a hand orthosis/exoskeleton. 

This repository holds files related to a graduation assignment for the Saxion University of applied sciences.
The MSWC dataset is used in combination with the MobileNetV3 architecture for the CNN.

The folders have the following purposes:

**Dataset**                     Holds the dataset that is used. The dataset consits of certain parts/words of the MSWC dataset.

**On-device inference**         Holds all the needed files for the inference that is used on the Raspberry Pi 4B. A trained model is also needed but not included

**Pre-processing&Training**     Holds pre-processing scripts for the MSWC dataset and the notebook that is used for training the model.

**Trained models**              Holds several pre-trained models.
